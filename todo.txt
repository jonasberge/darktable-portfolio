- animation of the text:
make it so that when we go the the next the text goes up
and the new text appears from below,
and vice versa when we go to the previous month.

- clicking an image should open the viewer at that image
and the viewer should be aware of the gallery's photos,
their order and should copy and stack the accordingly,
whenever the user scrolls or presses the next/previous buttons.
also it should integrate with the navigation menu,
giving the desired functions to the buttons,
hiding the left and right site navigation
and adding a close button
and a hint that the scroll wheel
and arrow keys can be used to navigate the viewer.

- about page ofc

- fade in/out the arrow keys when they appear and disappear

- make the month card's text not break on phone.

- maybe implement a data-max-width and data-max-height for images
so that they arent pixelated in the gallery
and they trigger a re-render with more columns
in case one of the images would get too large.
=> especially because we dont want to upload high-res images!


DONE

- when scrolling to a target month (by using the header buttons),
not always will the scrolling cause the title to update
and one of the arrows to disappear when they should.
this might not be a desirable UX

- using the mouse and dragging it to scroll up and down
(not triggering any of the buttons)

- the cards with the month text need to have a fixed height
when they are on a single row (phone specifically)
